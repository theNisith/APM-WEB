      <h2>Message from the Managing Director</h2>
      <img src="images/MUR.jpg" alt="Eng. M.U.R. Dharmawardane" />
      <p>As a Sri Lankan citizen and a graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering specializing in Mechanical Engineering, I have had the privilege of serving in various esteemed roles throughout my professional journey. I am a Chartered Engineer accredited by the Institution of Engineers of Sri Lanka, a Member of the Engineering Council of Sri Lanka, and a Chartered Automobile Engineer accredited by the Institute of Automotive Engineers of Sri Lanka.</p>
      <p>My career began at the Export Development Board of Sri Lanka as a Packaging Engineer, followed by a tenure at the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, where I held positions such as Refit Engineer, Superintending Engineer (Marine), Chief Engineer (Mechanical Plants), and Resident Manager for the Port of Trincomalee. During my tenure as Resident Manager, I successfully transformed the Port of Trincomalee from a loss-making entity into a self-financing port.</p>
      <p>Today, I am committed to leading <strong>APM ASSOCIATES (Private) Limited</strong> to deliver expert engineering services and procurement solutions to our clients in both the public and private sectors. Our mission is to provide innovative, reliable, and efficient solutions that meet the highest industry standards.</p>
